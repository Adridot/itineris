This browser extension will help you whenever you need to frequently research for traveling times between the same places.
The best example is when looking for a new place to live. You would want to know how long it takes to go from this fancy place you found online to work, to your parent's or friends houses.

The steps are very simple:
1. Go to the options page and add the frequent addresses. (provide enough details for the app to know the exact place you are looking for)
2. Find any address you want to check, open the extension, select the way of travelling, the time if needed, and enter the address !
3. Wait for a few seconds and... tadam! You will have your results.
